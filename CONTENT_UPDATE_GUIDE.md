## Updating Projects

Projects are the centerpiece of your portfolio. Each project should showcase your best work.

### Location

Edit the `projects` array in [`src/data/content.js`](src/data/content.js:18)

### Project Structure

```javascript
{
  id: "unique-project-id",           // Unique identifier (lowercase-with-dashes)
  title: "Project Name",             // Display title
  category: "Project Category",      // e.g., "AI Cinematography", "VFX"
  year: "2024",                      // Year completed
  client: "Client Name",             // Client or company
  role: "Your Role",                 // Your role on the project
  description: "Short description",  // 1-2 sentences (shown in grid)
  longDescription: "Detailed...",    // 3-4 paragraphs (for case studies)
  technologies: ["Tool1", "Tool2"],  // Array of tools/technologies used
  images: {
    hero: "/images/projects/...",    // Main project image
    gallery: [...]                   // Array of additional images
  },
  video: "/videos/projects/...",     // Optional: demo reel path
  link: "#case-study-id",            // Link to case study or external URL
  featured: true,                    // Show on homepage
  metrics: {                         // Optional: project metrics
    key: "value"
  },
  recognition: "Award or note"       // Optional: special recognition
}
```

### Step-by-Step: Update a Project

1. **Open** [`src/data/content.js`](src/data/content.js:1)

2. **Find** the project you want to update (e.g., "Nexus Protocol")

3. **Replace** placeholder text with your real content:

```javascript
{
  id: "my-real-project",
  title: "My Actual Project Name",
  category: "AI-Enhanced VFX",
  year: "2024",
  client: "Real Client Name",
  role: "Lead VFX Artist & Technical Director",
  
  description: "Replace this with your concise 1-2 sentence project summary that will appear in the project grid. Make it compelling!",
  
  longDescription: "Replace with full project description. Tell the story: What was the challenge? What was your approach? What tools did you use? What was the outcome? Include specific details that demonstrate your expertise. This appears in case study modals or detail pages.",
  
  technologies: [
    "ComfyUI",
    "After Effects", 
    "Python",
    "DaVinci Resolve"
    // Add your actual tools
  ],
  
  images: {
    hero: "/images/projects/my-project-hero.jpg",
    gallery: [
      "/images/projects/my-project-01.jpg",
      "/images/projects/my-project-02.jpg",
      "/images/projects/my-project-03.jpg"
    ]
  },
  
  video: "/videos/projects/my-project-reel.mp4",
  link: "https://vimeo.com/your-video-id", // Or internal link
  featured: true,
  
  metrics: {
    duration: "8 weeks",
    shots: "120+",
    team: "4 artists"
  },
  
  recognition: "Featured at SIGGRAPH 2024"
}
```

4. **Add** your project images to [`public/images/projects/`](public/images/projects/)

5. **Save** and test with `npm run dev`

### Adding New Projects

To add more than 5 projects:

```javascript
export const projects = [
  // ... existing 5 projects ...
  
  // Add new project at the end
  {
    id: "new-project-6",
    title: "New Project Title",
    category: "Category",
    year: "2024",
    // ... rest of project data
  }
];
```

### Removing Projects

Simply delete or comment out projects you don't want to display:

```javascript
export const projects = [
  // First project stays
  {
    id: "project-1",
    // ...
  },
  
  /*
  // Commenting out project-2 (won't display)
  {
    id: "project-2",
    // ...
  },
  */
  
  // Third project stays
  {
    id: "project-3",
    // ...
  }
];
```

### Project Tips

**‚úÖ DO:**
- Use high-quality hero images (1920√ó1080 or larger)
- Write compelling, specific descriptions
- Include measurable outcomes (metrics)
- List all relevant tools and technologies
- Keep featured projects to 5-7 for best impact

**‚ùå DON'T:**
- Use low-resolution or placeholder images
- Write vague descriptions like "This was a great project"
- Exceed 10 featured projects (gets overwhelming)
- Forget to add corresponding images to `/public/images/projects/`

```

### Adding Images Step-by-Step

1. **Prepare your images:**
   - Crop/edit in your preferred tool
   - Export at correct dimensions
   - Compress to target file size

2. **Name your files clearly:**
   ```
   project-name-hero.jpg
   project-name-01.jpg
   project-name-02.jpg
   award-organization-logo.svg
   ```

3. **Place in correct directory:**
   - Projects: `public/images/projects/`
   - Awards: `public/images/awards/`
   - Profile: `public/images/profile/`

4. **Update paths in [`content.js`](src/data/content.js:1):**
   ```javascript
   images: {
     hero: "/images/projects/project-name-hero.jpg",
     gallery: [
       "/images/projects/project-name-01.jpg",
       "/images/projects/project-name-02.jpg"
     ]
   }
   ```

5. **Test locally:**
   - Run `npm run dev`
   - Check all images load
   - Verify image quality
   - Check file sizes in Network tab

### Video Optimization

**Using HandBrake (Free, Recommended):**
1. Download [HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/)
2. Import your video
3. Preset: "Web" ‚Üí "Gmail Large 3 Minutes 720p30"
4. Adjust:
   - Video: RF 25-28 (higher = smaller file)
   - Dimensions: 1920√ó1080 max
5. Export to `public/videos/projects/`

**Using FFmpeg (Command Line):**
```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -crf 28 -preset slow -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.mp4
```

**Video Hosting Alternatives:**

Instead of self-hosting, consider:
- **Vimeo** (Recommended): Professional, high-quality playback
- **YouTube**: Free, but ads may appear
- **Wistia**: Professional video hosting with analytics

Then embed or link instead of hosting files:
```javascript
video: "https://vimeo.com/your-video-id"
```

**Images not loading?**
- Check file path starts with `/` not `./`
- Verify file actually exists in `public/` directory
- Check file name matches exactly (case-sensitive)

**Text changes not showing?**
- Save the [`content.js`](src/data/content.js:1) file
- Refresh browser (Ctrl/Cmd + R)
- Clear browser cache if needed (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + R)

**Broken after editing?**
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Look for JavaScript syntax errors (missing commas, quotes)
- Restore from Git if needed: `git checkout src/data/content.js`
