## About Mascha

I'm a creative technologist and visual artist based in Berlin, specializing in the intersection of artificial intelligence and cinematic storytelling. With a background spanning traditional VFX, computational arts, and machine learning, I help production companies and creative studios harness the power of AI to push visual boundaries while maintaining artistic integrity.

My approach combines technical expertise in tools like ComfyUI, Stable Diffusion, and real-time rendering engines with a deep understanding of cinematography, composition, and visual narrative. I believe AI is most powerful not as a replacement for human creativity, but as a collaborative tool that opens new aesthetic possibilities.

Over the past five years, I've contributed to major feature films, developed award-winning interactive installations, and pioneered techniques in real-time AI generation for live entertainment. My work has been recognized by SIGGRAPH, VES, D&AD, and featured in publications worldwide.

I'm passionate about:
- **Innovation in Film VFX** - Developing AI workflows that enhance rather than replace traditional craftsmanship
- **Real-Time Visual Systems** - Creating responsive, generative environments for live performance and installation
- **Knowledge Sharing** - Speaking at industry conferences and mentoring the next generation of creative technologists
- **Technical Artistry** - Finding the sweet spot where cutting-edge technology meets compelling visual storytelling

**Currently Available For:**
- Feature film VFX supervision and AI pipeline development
- High-end commercial visual effects and art direction
- Interactive installation design and technical production
- Research and development collaborations
- Speaking engagements and workshops

Let's create something extraordinary together.
